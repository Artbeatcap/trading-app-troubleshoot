ðŸ“ˆ Options Plunge - Morning Brief
August 20, 2025

================================================================================

MARKET OVERVIEW
Indexes are flat after yesterday's tight range; with light news flow, expect range trading unless levels break.

================================================================================

MACRO/DATA
Housing Starts surprised to the upside (1.43M vs 1.29M expected). Rate-cut expectations make housing-sensitive names a focal point.


================================================================================

EARNINGS IN FOCUS

â€¢ HD: Small miss on rev/EPS ($45.3B vs $45.41B; $4.68 vs $4.72) but reiterated FY; momentum in smaller projects; retail sympathy with TGT tomorrow.

â€¢ PANW: +6% AH on revenue/EPS beat ($2.54B vs $2.50B; $0.95 vs $0.89); margin strength; watch cyber basket for continuation.





================================================================================

KEY LEVELS
SPY: S1 642.13 | S2 641.34/640 | R1 643.95 | R2 644.70 | R3 645.50+


================================================================================

DAY PLAN

â€¢ Fade extremes of the range until it breaks; size down in chop.

â€¢ Track HD for retail read-through and position into TGT tomorrow.

â€¢ Cybersecurity leaders (PANW) for trend continuation on pullbacks.


================================================================================

SWING PLAN

â€¢ Housing-linked names if data strength + rate-cut narrative persists; look for bases resolving higher.

â€¢ If SPY reclaims 644.70/645.50 and holds, consider adding to strength; lose 640 with momentum and tighten risk.



================================================================================

ON DECK
Target (TGT) earnings tomorrow; monitor retail read-through.
