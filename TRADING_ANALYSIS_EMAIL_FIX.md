# Trading Analysis Email Confirmation Fix

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

You're absolutely right! There are **two different applications running**:

1. **Old App (optionsplunge)**: Running from `/var/www/venvs/optionsplunge/` (since Aug 13)
2. **New App (trading-analysis)**: Running from `/home/tradingapp/trading-analysis/` (the correct one)

The **old app is serving the website** and blocking the new app from starting due to port conflicts.

## ✅ **What's Already Fixed**

1. ✅ **Files Updated**: All email functions deployed to `/home/tradingapp/trading-analysis/`
2. ✅ **SendGrid**: Installed and working in trading-analysis environment
3. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly configured in trading-analysis .env
