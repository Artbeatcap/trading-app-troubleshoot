# Stripe Pricing Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the new pricing system with Stripe integration for Options Plunge.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install Stripe**: `pip install stripe==7.11.0`
2. **Run Migration**: `python migrate_subscription_fields.py`
3. **Configure Stripe**: Set up your Stripe account and get API keys
4. **Update Environment**: Add Stripe variables to your `.env` file
5. **Test**: Visit `/pricing` to test the checkout flow

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Stripe account (free to set up)
- Python 3.7+
- Flask application running

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The Stripe library has been added to `requirements.txt`. Install it:

```bash
pip install stripe==7.11.0
```

### 2. Database Migration

Run the migration script to add subscription fields to your User model:

```bash
python migrate_subscription_fields.py
```

This will add the following columns to your `user` table:
- `subscription_status` (free, trialing, active, canceled)
- `plan_type` (none, monthly, annual)
- `stripe_customer_id` (unique)
- `stripe_subscription_id` (unique)

### 3. Stripe Account Setup

#### Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account
2. Complete the account verification process
3. Switch to test mode for development

#### Get API Keys
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
3. Keep these secure - never commit them to version control

#### Create Products and Prices
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)
2. Create a new product called "Options Plunge Pro"
3. Add two prices:
   - **Monthly**: $29/month
   - **Annual**: $228/year ($19/month billed annually)
4. Copy the Price IDs (they start with `price_`)

#### Set Up Webhooks
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set the endpoint URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/billing/webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret

### 4. Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-secret-key-here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-webhook-secret-here

# Stripe Price IDs
STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY=price_your-monthly-price-id
STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL=price_your-annual-price-id
```

### 5. Test the Setup

1. Start your Flask application
2. Visit `/pricing` to see the pricing page
3. Test the checkout flow with Stripe test cards:
   - Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Scenarios
