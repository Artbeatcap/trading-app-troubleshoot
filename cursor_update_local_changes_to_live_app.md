I'll help you update the local changes to the live app. First, let me check the current state of the live app and then deploy your local changes.


Now let me check what changes you have locally that need to be deployed. I can see you have a `models.py` file open with some changes. Let me check the current status of your local repository and then create a deployment package.


I can see you have many local changes that need to be deployed. Let me create a deployment package with all your changes and upload it to the server. I'll use the existing deployment infrastructure.


Let me fix the PowerShell date command:


Let me check what tar file was created:


Perfect! Now let me upload this package to the server and deploy it:


Now let me connect to the server and deploy the update:


Now let me restart the application service to apply the changes:


Let me check the status of the service to make sure it's running properly:


Great! The service is running successfully. Let me also check if there are any database migrations that need to be run:


Let me check the correct virtual environment path:


I see there are two virtual environments. Let me check which one the service is using and run the migration:


Let me install the requirements in the new virtual environment:


Now let me try running the migration again:


Let me check what's in the requirements.txt and install manually:


Let me install Flask manually first:


Now let me try the migration again:


Let me install all the requirements properly:


Great! Now let me try running the migration:


Perfect! The migration ran successfully. Now let me update the service to use the new virtual environment and restart it:


Let me check the service status to make sure everything is running properly:


Excellent! The service is running successfully. Let me also check if there are any specific database migrations that need to be run:


I see the issue - the app is trying to use psycopg2 but we installed psycopg. Let me install psycopg2 as well:


Now let me restart the service to use the updated environment:


Let me check the final status:


Perfect! Let me also verify that the website is accessible:


Excellent! The deployment has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:
