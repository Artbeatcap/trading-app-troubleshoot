Postgres Migration Guide

This project is a Flask app. We force a single source of truth for database configuration via the DATABASE_URL environment variable and remove all SQLite fallbacks.

Oneâ€‘time migration script

1) Upload and run the script on your VPS:

```
sudo chmod +x ops/nuke_to_postgres.sh
sudo ./ops/nuke_to_postgres.sh
```

What it does:
- Stops the systemd service
- Verifies PostgreSQL connectivity (creates role/db if possible)
- Installs psycopg (psycopg2-binary fallback) and Flask-Migrate
- Writes a systemd drop-in with Environment=DATABASE_URL=...
- Removes any SQLite files
- Fails if sqlite:// or sqlite3 remain in code
- Writes .env with DATABASE_URL=...
- Runs migrations (flask db upgrade or db.create_all() fallback)
- Restarts the service and shows table list via \dt

Rollback

If you need to revert to a prior state:
- Restore your previous database from backup
- Remove the systemd drop-in file at /etc/systemd/system/<SERVICE>.service.d/override.conf
- systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart <SERVICE>

Verification

- grep -R "sqlite" . returns no hits in app code (excluding .git and venv)
- If Postgres is stopped and the app is started, the service fails fast (no SQLite file created)
- psql -U <user> -d <db> -c "\dt" shows the app tables
- App boots and serves normally when Postgres is up
