      <p><strong>Options Plunge</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") operates a trading tools and education platform available via our website and web app (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>
      <p><em>Plain English version:</em> we collect only what we need to run your account, authenticate with Google if you choose, send emails you signed up for, process payments, and improve the app. We don't sell your personal information.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are & how to contact us</h2>

      </ul>
      <h3>Communications</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>4) When we share information</h2>
    <p>We don't sell your personal information. We share only with service providers that help us run the Services, under contracts that require them to protect your data, such as:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Stripe.</li>
      <li><strong>Email delivery:</strong> our email service provider for account emails and market briefs.</li>
      <li><strong>Market data & infrastructure:</strong> market-data APIs (e.g., Tradier, Finnhub) and hosting/CDN providers needed to deliver the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the public.</p>

    <h2>5) Data retention</h2>

      <li>Account data are kept while your account is active. You can request deletion at any time.</li>
      <li>Server logs are generally retained for a limited period for security and operations.</li>
      <li>Backup copies may persist for a short time as part of our disaster recovery processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Your choices & rights</h2>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can request account deletion at <a href="mailto:support@optionsplunge.com">support@optionsplunge.com</a>. Deletion may be irreversible.</li>
      <li><strong>Emails:</strong> Use the unsubscribe link in non-transactional emails.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> You can control cookies in your browser; some features may not work without them.</li>
      <li><strong>Region-specific rights:</strong> Depending on where you live (e.g., EEA/UK under GDPR, California under CPRA), you may have additional rights such as data portability or objection. Contact us to exercise these rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard protections such as TLS encryption in transit and hashed passwords. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work to protect your data and investigate incidents if they occur.</p>

    <h2>8) Children</h2>
    <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13, and we don't knowingly collect personal information from them.</p>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process data in the United States and other countries where our service providers operate. We take measures to protect data consistent with this policy.</p>

    <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
