# Email Confirmation - Final Fix Required

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

2. ✅ **Files Updated**: All files updated in `/var/www/optionsplunge/`
3. ✅ **SendGrid**: Installed and working in production environment
4. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly configured

**The production service needs to be restarted** to load the new email functions.

## 🚀 **Manual Fix Required**

You need to restart the production service manually (requires sudo access):

### **Step 1: SSH to VPS**
